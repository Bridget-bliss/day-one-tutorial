    Part I - Meeting HTML in Its Natural Environment
    It has come to our attention that Earth has fallen well short of 
        producing its yearly quota of Znufengerbs. To help you improve your 
        production and establish a plentiful Znufengerb colony, I, Zog, the 
        Minister of Agriculture of Grustland, will be arriving on your planet 
        within the week along with my herd experts to take command of your 
        Znufengerb enterprise.
 </p>
 <p>Do not fear, I have the highest expectations for a smooth transition 
    from your current production of the creatures you call cows to our beloved
    Znufengerbs. The future of the galaxy hinges on Earthâ€™s ability to meet 
    its Znufengerb quota, and I will do all in my power to make you the most
    productive source of Znufengerbs in the universe.
</p>
<p>I have studied your history extensively and feel that I am the best 
    candidate for the position of Znufengerb Minister. I look forward to 
    placing a Znufengerb in every home to bring you joy.
</p>
<br>sincerely,</br>
zog, minister of agriculture
